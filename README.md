# Tech Blog - John Zigterman

## Description

- I set out to create a tech bloggin application that was easy to use.
- The features of the app are meant to be loggin in and out to create posts and leave comments on others posts.
- This is a full stack application that can be accessed by browser when loaded onto a server.
- This project requires several npm packages and a local hosting setup.

## Installation

The user must create the database using the provided schema, and seed it by typing 'npm run seed'. They then can install all of the necessary npm packages by typing 'npm i' in the console. The user can then run the server by typing 'npm start"

## Usage

The user simply accesses the web page using their browser and follows conventional prompts to achieve desired results.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
